# React-AST-App-Editor

Edit visually:
 - [ ] package.json
  - - [ ] Scripts editor, package listing, NPM version checks.
 - [ ] App.tsx
  - - [ ] Basic imports. At least, an import-editing section. Even if plain text. So that file sections can begin separation
  - - [ ] Component-contents editing. Basic ability to add React-Router routing. And Maybe hook-router. With GUI-built, pre-defined AST templates
  - - [ ] Built-in hook adding/editing?
